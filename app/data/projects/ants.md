# Langton's Ant Simulation in Haskell

## Overview

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a simple set of rules that can lead to complex emergent behavior. This project implements a simulation of Langton's Ant using Haskell, leveraging the language's powerful functional programming paradigms to create an efficient and visually appealing application. The simulation includes animation capabilities, allowing users to visualize the ant's movement and the evolving grid of cells.

## Motivations

The primary motivation behind this project was to explore the capabilities of Haskell in handling complex state transformations and animations. Langton's Ant serves as an excellent candidate for such an exploration due to its simplicity in rules juxtaposed with the complexity of its emergent patterns. By implementing this simulation, the project aims to demonstrate the elegance and efficiency of functional programming in managing immutable state and performing recursive computations.

## Technologies and Tools

-   **Haskell**: Chosen for its strong static typing, purity, and expressive syntax, Haskell provides a solid foundation for implementing complex algorithms with concise and readable code.
-   **Gloss**: A Haskell library for creating simple graphics and animations, Gloss facilitates the visualization of the ant's movement and the state of the grid.
-   **Stack**: Utilized for build management, Stack ensures reproducible builds and simplifies dependency management.
-   **Tasty, HUnit, QuickCheck**: These testing libraries are employed to ensure the correctness and reliability of the simulation through unit tests and property-based testing.

## Technical Highlights

### Functional Programming in Haskell

Haskell's functional nature allows for clear and concise implementations of recursive algorithms and state transformations. The project leverages higher-order functions, immutability, and pattern matching to manage the ant's state and the grid of cells efficiently.

### Implementation of Langton's Ant

The core logic of Langton's Ant is encapsulated in the `Ants.hs` module. Key functions and decisions include:

-   **State Representation**: The `AntState` data type encapsulates the ant's direction, position, and the set of "On" (black) tiles.

    ```haskell:path/to/Ants.hs
    initialState :: AntState
    initialState = AS West (0, 0) Set.empty
    ```

-   **Rule Application**: The `applyRule` function uses `zipWith3` to apply rules across the grid, ensuring efficient traversal and state updates.

    ```haskell:path/to/Ants.hs
    applyRule :: (CellState -> CellState -> CellState -> CellState) -> LineState -> LineState
    applyRule rule (LS list) = LS $ zipWith3 rule (Off : list) list (drop 1 list <> [Off])
    ```

-   **Direction Management**: Functions `leftOf` and `rightOf` manage the ant's turning logic using pattern matching for optimal performance.

    ```haskell:path/to/Ants.hs
    leftOf :: Direction -> Direction
    leftOf dir = case dir of
      North -> West
      East  -> North
      South -> East
      West  -> South

    rightOf :: Direction -> Direction
    rightOf dir = Set.elemAt (succ (Set.findIndex dir allDirs) `mod` 4) allDirs
      where
        allDirs :: Set Direction
        allDirs = Set.fromList [North, East, South, West]
    ```

### Animation with Gloss

The `animation` function utilizes Haskell's lazy evaluation and Gloss's rendering capabilities to display the ant's movement dynamically.

```haskell:path/to/Animation.hs
animation :: Int -> Image
animation frame = draw (iterate step initialState !! frame)
```

This approach ensures that each frame is computed on-demand, optimizing performance and memory usage.

### Efficient Data Structures

The use of `Data.Set` for managing the set of "On" tiles ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and membership checks, which are crucial for the simulation's performance, especially as the grid grows.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Managing Infinite Lists

Haskell's lazy evaluation allows the simulation to handle potentially infinite sequences of ant states without significant memory overhead. The `loopedAt` function efficiently detects cycles in the ant's movement by leveraging recursion and list membership checks.

```haskell:path/to/Ants.hs
loopedAt :: (CellState -> CellState -> CellState -> CellState) -> LineState -> Int
loopedAt rule (LS line) = check rule (LS line) [] 0
  where
    check :: (CellState -> CellState -> CellState -> CellState) -> LineState -> [LineState] -> Int -> Int
    check f state visited counter
      | state `elem` visited = counter
      | otherwise = check f (applyRule f state) (state : visited) (counter + 1)
```

### Optimizing Performance

Ensuring that the simulation runs smoothly required careful consideration of data structures and algorithmic choices. Utilizing `foldr1` for tile drawing and `Data.Set` for managing active tiles were pivotal in maintaining performance even as the grid size increased.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the power and elegance of Haskell in implementing complex simulations with efficiency and clarity. By leveraging functional programming paradigms, robust testing frameworks, and efficient data structures, the Langton's Ant simulation not only performs well but also serves as a testament to the benefits of Haskell in managing stateful computations and recursive algorithms. The project stands as a compelling addition to a developer's portfolio, highlighting technical proficiency and a deep understanding of functional programming concepts.
