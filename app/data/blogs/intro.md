## Who?

I'm Nikita, a Computer Science student at the University of Warwick. I hope this website will be a record of my journey through university, and a collection of projects I had fun working on.

## Why?

I will document my learning journey to solidify my understanding of concepts and to share my knowledge with others. I do believe that teaching is the best way to learn.

## When?

I will make it a personal challenge to write quite regularly, when I have a moment.
